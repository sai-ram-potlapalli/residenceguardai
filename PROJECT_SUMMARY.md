# ResidenceGuard AI - Project Summary

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
ResidenceGuard AI is an intelligent system that automates dorm room policy violation detection using artificial intelligence. It transforms manual room inspections into an efficient, AI-powered process.

## ⚡ **Core Innovation**
- **AI-Powered Object Detection**: Uses CLIP model to identify items in room photos
- **Intelligent Policy Matching**: Automatically compares detected objects against housing policies
- **LLM-Based Assessment**: Uses HuggingFace LLM to determine violations with confidence scores
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates professional PDF reports instantly

## 🚀 **Key Features**
- 📸 **Smart Image Analysis** - Detects furniture, appliances, decorations
- 📄 **Policy Document Processing** - Extracts and indexes rules from PDFs
- 🤖 **AI Violation Assessment** - Determines policy breaches intelligently
- 📋 **Professional Reports** - Creates detailed incident documentation
- 📧 **Email Integration** - Sends automated notifications
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface** - Clean Streamlit web application

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**
